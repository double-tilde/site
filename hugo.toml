I decided to build it with Hugo, which is a static site framework built with Go, the syntax is simple and has a lot of built in features useful for templating like render hooks and shortcodes.", "The name for my website comes from my interest in philosophy, logic, and programming. The double tilde sign is used for approximation and negation in these subjects, it also looks cool as a logo."]

      description = "The second course I took via WatSPEED was focused on a specific area of machine learning. The supervised machine learning course was eight weeks and explored various techniques, including algorithms of regression (linear and logical) and classification (Naïve Bayes, k-NN), model performance, feature selection, tree-based methods and support vector machines. We then used these models in Python. Next, we compared the performance of the classification models and implemented various cross-validation techniques. We applied feature selection, shrinkage methods and support vector machines and learnt about the benefits of these different techniques. Finally, we applied tree-based methods to the regression and classification models. Learning about the specific area of supervised machine learning made ML feel more approachable as a whole."

      description = "Through my position as a web designer, I was able to take WatSPEED courses, shorter programs available through the University of Waterloo. I decided to look into machine learning. I completed a seven week course that focused on the foundational skills for machine learning such as terminology, methods, and best practices for data preparation. The course covered how to apply data manipulation techniques to prepare data sets, how to handle missing values, duplicates, categorical data, and outliers. We then moved on to splitting a data set into training and test sets and then used feature scaling methods to transform the data. We finally created data visualizations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas and explored the challenges of using certain models. Overall, I gained a broader understanding of machine learning and what it can be used for."
