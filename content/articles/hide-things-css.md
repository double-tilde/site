Despite the simple syntax, CSS is know for not behaving as expected by designers and developers. Positioning is the classic example, with the "how to centre a div" question still circulating the internet, even with the availability of flexbox and grid for the [better part of a decade](https://caniuse.com/css-grid) now. Part of the issue is the simplicity of CSS syntax. People tend to brute-force CSS, learn a few properties, learn the basics, and then make an educated guess for the rest. When was the last time you gave the [CSS docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility) a read through from top to bottom when learning about a property or new feature? I am guilty of this too, recently I have been learning Go and taking a Python Machine Learning course, the documentation for these languages are bookmarked in my browser and I have a Go programming book sat on my desk with notes on these languages in my Obsidian vault.

I started learning CSS and HTML when I was first interested in web development over 6 years ago. I learnt by watching [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) and [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) tutorials. These languages are often treated like stepping stones to real programming, so whilst watching tutorials will help you grasp the ideas, especially when you are short on time, It is important to get into the habit of going to the documentation before watching YouTube or asking a chatbot.

Visibility in CSS is another area of grief, why should you use the `visibility` property instead of `opacity`, and when should you opt for the latter? I will go over all the ways to use these properties, and at the end of this article I will outline where you learn more about them.
