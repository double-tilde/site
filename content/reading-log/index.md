This is a list of some of the articles and books I read so I can revisit them in the future and keep a history of them. I formed a good habit of reading in 2024, but I didn't have a central repository of what I had read and I felt that was missing.

I usually add longer articles here or articles that really intrigued me, rather than daily news pieces, to keep the list tidy. The headings indicate the year I read the source, not the year it was published. Sometimes there are notes under the source, but for the most part this is just a list where you might find an interesting read. My opinions are not reflected by the list either, if one article is for piracy and another against, I cannot possibly be in agreement with both.

*The tags next to the link provide the format, source, location(s) and any notable people or topics involved.*
