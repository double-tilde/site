title = 'Reading Log'

This is a list of some of the articles and books I read so I can revisit them in the future and keep a history of them. I formed a good habit of reading in 2024, but I didn't have a central repository of what I had read and I felt that was missing.

I usually add longer articles here or articles that really intrigued me, rather than daily news pieces, to keep the list tidy. The headings indicate the year and month that I read the source, not the year it was published. Sometimes there are notes under the source, but for the most part this is just a list where you might find an interesting read. My opinions are not reflected by the list either, if one article argues that piracy is ethical and another argues the exact opposite, I cannot possibly be in agreement with both.

*The tags next to the link provide the format, source, location(s) and any notable people or topics involved.*
