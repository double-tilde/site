## About Me

I'm currently a web designer and developer in the learning services sector (based in the UK). In my spare time I play the guitar, go to the gym, and attempt to play tennis. I spend a lot of time tinkering, from 2024 I started using Linux and a window manager on my computer, customising the set up into something productive and pretty (checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/double-tilde/dotfiles)). This changed my perspective on programming, I used to find web design more exciting than running CLI apps, but now I see the importance of good design in places where it is less obvious like the terminal. In general, I want to move more into the development space, using my experience in web design to create high quality sites and tools.

### My Background

Often those who work in tech have a background building computers or they created their first website at 10 years old. My journey into development was not straight forward, but I have always been interested in doing projects. In school I would spend hours editing videos for group projects on iMovie, my friends would ask me to design logos for their YouTube channels in GIMP. I always trusted myself to figure out a DAW or graphics editor.

Not knowing what I wanted to do next, I decided to study Philosophy at university, but dropped out after 2 years for health reasons. After that I leaned on my experience in Graphic Design and Computer Programming in sixth form to teach myself web development basics and get a job as a web designer. I have not stopped self studying, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes on everything from programming to politics to music.

## About This Site

On this site you'll find articles about technology, development and other subjects I find interesting. I want to document and share what I learn formally with the goal of doing more teaching or course creation in the future. I think it's important to your own learning to teach others, on a personal level it helps you to develop a deeper understanding and become more confident in presenting information, and on a community level, programming is built on a foundation of sharing what we learn with others.

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which has a lot of built in functionality, great documentation and many themes to choose from, I chose to build this theme myself. Along with Hugo, I am using [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) and [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for converting GitHub issues into comments. I host this site on my GitHub.
